Database:
1.It is an information store permanently inside the hard disk.
2.It play very important role for entire application information 
3.Backend will fetch the data from databse after authentication and authorization process.
4.We have two approach to access database 
      1.SQL - structure query language ( relations) - Oracle,mssqlserver
      2.NoSQL - No structure query language( no relations) - mongodb,couchdb 
ACID
Atomicity - each transaction insid the table should complete entire process otherwise data should be rollback
Consistency  - all table will have sync data.
Isolation-multiple transactions will happen concurrently but separately.
Durability - Even in the case of hardware or software is failed still data will be available
CAP
Consistency
availability 
partition tolerance - If you do veritcal scaling then dividing the data equally to each machine easily taken care by mongodb.
