MERN
M - Mongodb (Database)
E - Expressjs (framework of Nodejs)
R - Reactjs (library of javascript)
N - Nodejs (run environment for javascript)

Purpose of Backend language:
1.it should support file system 
2.it should interact with database system 
3.it should support network system 
4.it should interact with os 

Nodejs and chrome browser using same engine called (v8)

Nodejs architecture - (first 5 points)
1.Single thread (process in execution)
2.stack - all primitive types and function will called here - (LIFO)
3.queue - all async code will get store here - (FIFO)
4.heap - array and object will get store
5.event loop - taking care of request and response - It is running infinitely.
6.web api - is only in browser 
7.internal thread pool - is only available in nodejs 

Core package Inside the Nodejs 
1.fs - You can access file system 
2.os - You can operating system
3.path - you can access file path 
4.http - get and post api call, you can create web server 

How to import files:
1.import/export - async in nature - Babel package - lower version of javascript
2.require - sync in nature

What is Event Emitter 
//It consists of two process 
     1.triggering event - (whenever data is available or data is ready);
     2.listenining to that event and returning response.
//all the code is written async in nature.   

How to json to javascript and javascript to json?
Frontend we need to send JSON 
Backend we need javascript object 
JSON convert into javascript object - JSON.parse()
javascript object into JSON - JSON.stringify()

http method:
HTTP - hyper text transfer protocol
1.html,css,javascript,json,image,video is supported to send from backend to frontend 
2.please practice the code of http server creation without help of expressjs 
3.HTTP method structure:
Header portion - ALL METHODS HAVE HEADER PORTION
   1.content-type 
   2.url 
       //params 
               http://localhost:3000/45
       //query params - optional
                 http://localhost:3000?name=akash&location=bangalore
   3.ip address 
   4.custom headers - jwt token 
Body portion  - ONLY POST,DELETE,PATCH WILL HAVE BODY PORTION 
        PAYLOAD={
          "name":"akash"
          "age":34,
          "status":true,
          "hobbies":[44,565,66],
          "address":{
                doorNo:"12"
          },
          salary:null
        }

4.List of http Methods:
GET - get the information 
POST - payload will send inside the body part 
PATCH 
DELETE

5.Status code http methods 
200 or 300 - success 
400 or 500 - error 

What is expressjs?
//It is a third party framework for nodejs 
Benefits:
1.east to write restapi
2.routing setup we can done in easy way 
3.template engine support - (handlebars-expresshandlebars)
4.error handling - middleware 
5.middleware support 


To setup the backend project.
1.First we need package.json file.
     //it is configuration file particular for javascript project 
           //packages you have install 
           //how to generate test case
           //how to generate production code 
           //version and name of project 
           //script command helps to run code/test/production.
Creating package.json file 
cmd:npm init
