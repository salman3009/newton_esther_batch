How to Setup Express app
1.create one new folder called express_project
2.create one file inside this folder named app.js 
3.open terminal and type "npm init"  to initialized package.json
4.install the express app by typing in terminal: npm i expressjs
5.Finally create the server and listen to it.
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.listen(3000,()=>{
    console.log("server is running on 3000");
})

Sending Data from frontend to backend using post method:
//params 
http://localhost:3000/45
//query params - optional
 http://localhost:3000?name=akash&location=bangalore
//payload
PAYLOAD={
          "name":"akash"
          "age":34,
          "status":true,
          "hobbies":[44,565,66],
          "address":{
                doorNo:"12"
          },
          salary:null
}

Backend if you need to access above data:
params:
      //req.params;
query params:
      //req.query 
payload:
      //req.body

How will you parse the incoming data in nodejs?
//we can use third party package called body-parser to parse the incoming data.
//body-parser will convert into javascript object so easily we can use it in our application.

Middleware:
//Handling incoming request
//Act in intermediate between request and response.
//All incoming request need to pass each middleware for validation check,authentication check and authorization check .if anything fail it will revert back to frontend by sending error response.
How to write middleware insid the expressjs 
//app.use() method 
//After doing everything just use next() method to proceed further.

how to send html file from backend.
//we need to use sendFile() from express to send the html file 

what is serversiderendering
//each html page will be serve from backend api
//Reactjs also we can render it from backend;

How to write mutiple middleware?
//we can attach mutiple middleware inside the routing mechanism of express.

How to make development easier for nodejs so that application restart automatically?
//third package called nodemon 
//whenever there is change in js file automatically it will updated.

How to store global data inside the express app and how we can pass to another middleware or controller 
//req is the global object we can pass any property here and we can able to access in any middelware or controller in that particular route.

What is authentication process?
//It is used to validate the user with credentials
//User will first register the data with our application 
//User after register they will try to login with credentials in our application
//Once we pass the login details it will be validated in the backend and will send the success response to frontend.

What is authorization process?
//authorization process will start after login 
//authorization will check whether login user have access for current action.
//Each user will have different access depends upon the roles.

How you will protected the api?
//We need to add middelware in between the controller to protect the api 
//Inside the middleware you can do validation check,token check etc.

How you will create dynamic api?
//By using params we can create dynamic api 
//Depends upon params detials will fetch particular data from database.

Which api method to fetch information
GET Method 
Which api to send details from frontend 
POST Method 
which api to update details 
PATCH Method 
Which api to delete details 
DELETE Method 

How you will store in environment file?
//create .env file 
//Install the package: npm i dotenv 
//To access it : process.env
//We can create multiple environment file so that easily we can connect to SIT,DEV,PREPROD,PROD 

How will you read a data from file
//we can inbuilt packgage 'fs' or 'fs/promises' to read file from local system.
fs/promises - will work in async way 
fs - will work both in sync and async 

What type of file you can able to read inside the nodejs 
//we can usually read txt file.
//csv or excel we can use third party package to convert into json and after that we can able to read it 

difference between dynamic api and static api 
static api - serving static html files or fetching data from database without any condition. 
dynamic api - send data depends upon params or query params

what is routing in backend?
//When application becomes very large it will be difficuilt to read all codes in one single function
//Routing helps to segregate into different controller for each api request 
//It helps code readable and maintability
//we can use express router to setup it

What is MVC pattern?
M - Model - Schema structure
V - View - html files  
C - Controller - business logic (database call,validation,auth check)

What is Database?
1.It is an information store permanently inside the hard disk.
2.It play very important role for entire application information 
3.We have two approach to access database 
      1.SQL - structure query language ( relations) - Oracle,mssqlserver
      2.NoSQL - No structure query language( no relations) - mongodb,couchdb 

ACID - SQL
Atomicity - each transaction insid the table should complete entire process otherwise data should be rollback
Consistency  - all table will have sync data.
Isolation-multiple transactions will happen concurrently but separately.
Durability - Even in the case of hardware or software is failed still data will be available

CAP NOSQL
Consistency
availability 
partition tolerance - If you do veritcal scaling then dividing the data equally to each machine easily taken care by mongodb.      

SQL vs NoSQL 
Table - collections 
records - documents 
primary key - primary key 
foreign key - no foreign key 

What is documents in mongodb 
//It is similar to javascript object 
//It consists of following datatype:string,number,boolean,date,array,object,null 
//We can have multiple documents inside each collections.

How to find unique element inside the mongodb?
primarykey:
1.It is unique key created for all the documents 
2.It is created by database default 
3._id will be created 

Benefits of Mongodb or NOSQL
//There is no datatype restriction 
//There is no restriction to remove property or to add the property
//There is no restriction to follow similar pattern 
//Mongodb is easy to use 
//Easy to deploy 
//Easy to learn 
//cost cutting 
//performance is also good 
//Driver is supported in latest technology in nodejs 
//vertical scaling 

What is ODM?
ODM - Object Data modelling 
Nodejs--->expressjs--->Mongoos(ODM)-->Mongodb 
Mongoose
//Provide proper datatype then only it will insert inside the database 
//Provide property name 
//Provide similar pattern of data 
//Schema creation is done 
//validation we can able to do (required,min,max,pattern,email)

By using Mongoose you are making similar to SQL then what is the benefits?
//There is no multiple tables like in sql to access we need to join all table together
//By using single document we can able to fetch all at a time. So it will improve the performance.
