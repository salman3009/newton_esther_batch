    // This way, all boxes' getValue method will refer to the same function, lowering memory usage. However, manually binding the __proto__ for every object creation is still very inconvenient. This is when we would use a constructor function, which automatically sets the [[Prototype]] for every object manufactured. Constructors are functions called with new.
    // A constructor function
function Box(value) {
  this.value = value;
}

// Properties all boxes created from the Box() constructor
// will have
Box.prototype.getValue = function () {
  return this.value;
};

const boxes = [new Box(1), new Box(2), new Box(3)];
