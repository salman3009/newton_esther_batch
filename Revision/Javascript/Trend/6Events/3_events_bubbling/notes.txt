Global Scope:
//any variable that is declare outside the function is called global scope
//This variable we can access in any function.
 
function scope:
//any variable is declare inside the function is called funciton scope. 
//we can use that variable only inside that particular function.
==========================================
eventListener:
1.whatever event we have used everything will work on eventListener. Instead on onclick we need to use click.
(please remove "on" keyword).

first class function:
//passing function name as parameter.
===========================================
Event Bubbling:
//user action in the browser is called event.
//One Event is getting called to another event in sequence of child to parent tree.
//Normally in javascript whenever you use event inside the nested element event bubbling will happen default.
//To avoid this problem you can pass event object and call the stopPropagation() method to stop further calling of event.
//This problem occurs in click event handler.
================================================
