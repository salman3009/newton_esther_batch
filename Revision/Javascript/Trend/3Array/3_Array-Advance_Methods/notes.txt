Notes:
1.map function
//map function will not change original array
//it will add/remove or check some condition and it will return new set of data.
//it consists of two parameter (i)each iteration value (ii)index value.
================================================
2.filter function:
//it will not change the original array 
//It is used to filter the data depends upon the condition.
//Once condition is met it will return the following value into the new array.
//filter consists of callback function.
==========================================
3.find function:
//it will not change the original array.
//It is used to find one particular data. IF matches found it will stop searching further
//it also consists of index parameter as well.
========================================
4.reduce function: 
//it will not change the original array. 
//it used to reduce the value into single parameter 
//it consists of two parameter one is return result and next one is iteraion value.
=======================================
5.findIndex  -- once match found it will return the index value it will from position 0.
6.findLast  - it will find the last vale once match is found it will start from position last.
7.findLastIndex - it will find the last occurence of that particular value in the given array. 
=============================================
8.some - any one value is met the condition it will return the boolean value true otherwise false.
9.every - if all the value is met the condition then only it will return true otherwise false.
