    // WeakMap is a new Data Structure or Collection introduced in ES6. WeakMaps allows you to store a collection of Key-Value pairs. It adopts the same properties of Map. The Major difference is that keys of WeakMap cannot be a primitive data type. The keys must be of type object and values can be of any data type. 

    // Another major difference is that the key of WeakMap is weakly referenced. It means that whenever an object is used as a key for WeakMap, that object can be garbage collected. It can happen when the reference to that object is lost( i.e. assign that object reference to NULL). And when the object is no longer in use, JavaScript Garbage Collection detects it and frees it from the memory. Therefore keys of WeakMaps are weakly referenced.
    // Creating a WeakMap Object
    const m = new WeakMap();

    // Adding elements in it

    // Remember, only object can
    // be a key in WeakMap
    obj1 = {}
    m.set(obj1, "Object 1");
    obj2 = {}
    m.set(obj2, "Object 2");

    // Use delete() function
    m.delete(obj2);

    // Print the WeakMap
    console.log(m);

    // Using get() function to get 
    // specific element in WeakMap
    console.log(m.get(obj1));

    // Using has() function to check
    // if a particular element is 
    // present in WeakMap or not.
    console.log(m.has(obj1));
