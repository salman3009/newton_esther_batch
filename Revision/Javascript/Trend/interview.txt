What is javascript?
1.It is dynamic language in web browser 
2.It will work as combination with html,css 
3.All browser as javascript compiler inbuilt present in it 
4.If you want to run javascript outside the browser you need to have nodejs
5.client side scripting 
6.interpreted language (line by line execution)
7.open source - (MIT license anyone can use it)
8.cross-platform (in any operating system it will run)
9.case sensitive (there is difference between capital and small letter)
10.Chrome browser(V8 Engine)
=======================================
Javascript you can write in two ways:
1.internal --->Inside the html file itself 
//you can use multiple script tag inside the html file. 
//Anywhere inside the html tag we can write either in head tag or body tag.
<script>
</script>
2.external ---> We are going to create separate .js file 
//in html we need to import their file location 
//It is more preferred way because html and css are in separate file 
//It will make code maintainability.
//Anywhere inside the html tag we can write either in head tag or body tag.
==========================================
What is variable?
variable: Storing some set of data inside the memory.
= assignment operator
synatax:
var laptopName = "sony"; 
===================================================
Datatype:depends upon the space we need to create data.
Primitive Types:
1.string 
2.number 
3.boolean 
4.undefined
5.null
6.symbols --> unique identifier
Non - Primitive Types:
1.Object
2.Array
=============================================
Javascript has dynamic typing
example:
var fullName = "rakesh";
fullName = 44;
==========================================
How to check datatype inside the javascript?
typeof variable_name 
==================================
Types of operator?
1.Arithmetic operator 
      //+,-,*,/,++,--
2.comparison operator 
      //!==,!=,<,>,<=,>-,==,===
3.Logical operator 
       //&&,||,!
4.conditional operator 
       condition?yes:no 
=======================================
Difference between == and === operator?
//== It will check only value 
//=== It will check value + datatype 
'3' == 3 - true 
'3' === 3 - false 
=====================================
String cancatenation 
//By using + symbol two string will combine together 
let result = "car" + "tata"
//car tata 
======================================================
Typescasting are two ways
//converting from one datatype to another datatype  
1.implicit 
   45 + hello = string type = 45hello 
2.explicit 
    Number("33")
    String()
    Boolean()
=======================================================
Decision Making 
1.if-else - else if ladder  
2.switch
false condition - '',0,null,NaN,undefined,false
===========================================
What is function?
//We can write resuable code in particular block so that we can reuse it later 
//We can call multiple times same function with different parameters 
//Function make code maintainability and it will increase the performance.
//return keyword will return the result of that function 
//To get dynamic inputs we can pass inside the parameters.
============================================
String methods:
1.length 
2.toLowerCase()
3.loUpperCase()
4.replace() - replacing the string with another new words
5.concat() - combination
6.trim() - removing white space
8.chartAt() - it will return character if we pass index
9.indexOf() - it will return index if we pass character
10.slice()/substring() - It will break the string into smaller portion
========================
Similar methods in array from strings 
1.length 
2.indexOf()
3.slice()
3.concat()
4.includes()
===================================
complexity of array:
Array will store the values continously.
Array index will start from zero.
1.Insertion - 0(1) it is inserted at the end position - (push())
0(N) it is inserted at the first position - (unshift())
2.removal - 0(1) it is removed at the end position - (pop())
0(N) it is at the first position. - (shift())
3.searching - 0(N) -find()
4.accessing - 0(1)
=============================================
Any problems 
input value is number --> string -->array 
input value is string--->array 
input value is object keep in object -->array 
===============================
Other Array methods:
1.splice() - it is similar to slice() method but it will change original array.
2.sort() - it will sort the array in ascending or descending
3.reverse()
4.includes() - it will boolean true if the value is present
6.isArray()
7.map function
//map function will not change original array
//it will add/remove or check some condition and it will return new set of data.
//it consists of two parameter (i)each iteration value (ii)index value.

8.filter function:
//it will not change the original array 
//It is used to filter the data depends upon the condition.
//Once condition is met it will return the following value into the new array.
//filter consists of callback function.

9.find function:
//it will not change the original array.
//It is used to find one particular data. IF matches found it will stop searching further
//it also consists of index parameter as well.

10.reduce function: 
//it will not change the original array. 
//it used to reduce the value into single parameter 
//it consists of two parameter one is return result and next one is iteraion value.

11.findIndex  -- once match found it will return the index value it will start from position 0 if not found it will return -1.
12.findLast  - it will find the last vale once match is found it will start from position last.
13.findLastIndex - it will find the last occurence of that particular value in the given array. 

14.some - any one value is met the condition it will return the boolean value true otherwise false.
15.every - if all the value is met the condition then only it will return true otherwise false.
==================
Converting array to string 
1.toString()
2.join()
====================
converting string to array 
1.split()
=========================
Callback function - some function we are going to call after some condition is met.
==============================================
Loops:
for 
while 
do/while - It will run atleast one time even in negative case.
statement 
break 
continue 
==================================
break 
//switch otherwise inside the loops(for,while,dowhile)
===================================
return 
//It will work only inside the function 
=====================================
loops for array 
//for of - real time for iteration we can use for of loop 
//forEach 
===========================================
Data structure:
1.Array - order important - key is constant
2.Object - no order - key is  unique - you need to give key
Object:
Object consists of properties and method 
//method is nothing but function 
this --> it will refer to current object 
To iterate the data inside the object we have for in loop.
Object methods:
1.Object.keys()
2.Object.values()
3.Object.entries()
4.hasOwnProperty()
for in 
======================================================
Array:
//Please initialize array always with [] 
//If we add null during initialize it will through the error 
==================================================
Math Method:
1.Number() 
2.parseInt()
3.parseFloat()
4.toFixed()
5.random()
==============================
Date:
//To display the date in javascript 
//YOu can display only year 
//You can display only month 
//You can display only hours,minutes,seconds
//you can combine together
//you can set the value 
//Date one type of inbuild object in javascript 
example:
var date = new Date();
console.log(date);
================================================
DOM:Document Object Modal 
//javascript need to interact with html 
//Each html element will be converted into object 
//tree like structure 
//window object it provided by javascript default 
//window object have hundreds of method to support CRUD operation
//Inside window we have document object 

Elements: p,h1,a,img,li,nav 
Attributes: id,name,class,readonly,disable.
Style and Class : css
Events:click,change,mouse..

Types of DOM Selectors:
//Use to access existing element.
1.getElementById:
//it will access the element using id attribute.
//innerHTML property will help you to add dynmic content inside the html.
style attribute:
//you can attach css properties
//inside this propery hypen is not allowed. Instead we need to add capital letter after hyphen and remove the hyphen symbol.

1.we can add the content 
2.we can set the attribute dynamically.example src 
3.we can write the inline style dynamically example  style.color 
4.we can write css class dynamically using classList.add()
=========================================
Events:
1.onClick 
2.onChange 
3.onSubmit
//Events will provide event object 
//It consists of multiple methods but mostly used 
//preventDefault()
//stopPropagation()
//target.id 
//target.name 
//target.checked 
//target.value 
===================================
