Points:
1.New technologies older browsers may not immediately support them.
2.A polyfill provides the functions and features that the developer expects the browser to offer by default.
3.If we use ES6 or ES7 or ES8 features in our code, it might not work in some older browsers due to a lack of support for the new features
4.A polyfill is a piece of code that adds functionality to older browsers that have incompatibility issues.

Setup:
1.npm init 
2.npm install @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/preset-env --save-dev
3.create a file .babelrc 
example:
{ "presets":["@babel/env"] }
4.npx babel promises.js --out-file promises_es5.js
