Mixin is a generic object-oriented programming term —
 is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes
  without a need to inherit from it.

Mixins allow objects to borrow functionality from them 
with a minimal amount of complexity. They can be viewed as objects with attributes and methods that can be easily
shared across a number of other object prototypes.

To make it clear, let’s take 
the same example above and see how it’s implemented in action

<script>
    // mixin
let cleanRoomMixin = {
     cleanRoom() {
     alert(`Hello ${this.name}, your room is clean now`);
},
sayBye() {
     alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);
}
};

// usage:
class User {
     constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
     }
}

// copy the methods
Object.assign(User.prototype, cleanRoomMixin);

// now User can clean the room
new User("Max").cleanRoom(); // Hello Max, your room is clean now!
</script>
