Enumerations or Enums are used to represent a fixed set of named values. However, Enums are not native to JavaScript, so they are usually implemented using objects or frozen arrays.
<script>
    const DaysOfWeek = Object.freeze({ 
    SUNDAY: 0, 
    MONDAY: 1, 
    TUESDAY: 2, 
    WEDNESDAY: 3, 
    THURSDAY: 4, 
    FRIDAY: 5, 
    SATURDAY: 6 
}); 
  
// Try to modify the enum 
// This will not change the Sunday variable 
DaysOfWeek.SUNDAY = 7;  
console.log(DaysOfWeek.SUNDAY)
</script>
