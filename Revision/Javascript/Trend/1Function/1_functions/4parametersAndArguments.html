We have introduced x and y here and changed the location of the 2 and 3. x and y are the parameters while 2 and 3 are the arguments here.

A parameter is one of the variables in a function. And when a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters.

When the function is called with add(2, 3) the arguments 2 and 3 are assigned to x and y, respectively. This means that in the function, x will be replaced with 2 and y will be replaced with 3.

If the function is called with a different argument, the same applies. Parameters are like placeholders for function arguments.
<script>
    function add(x, y){
	return x + y
}

add(2, 3)
