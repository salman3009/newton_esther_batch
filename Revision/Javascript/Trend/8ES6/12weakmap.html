    // WeakMap is a new Data Structure or Collection introduced in ES6. WeakMaps allows you to store a collection of Key-Value pairs. It adopts the same properties of Map. The Major difference is that keys of WeakMap cannot be a primitive data type. The keys must be of type object and values can be of any data type. 

    // Creating a WeakMap Object
    const m = new WeakMap();

    // Adding elements in it
    // Remember, only object can
    // be a key in WeakMap
    obj1 = {}
    m.set(obj1, "Object 1");
    obj2 = {}
    m.set(obj2, "Object 2");

    // Use delete() function
    m.delete(obj2);

    // Print the WeakMap
    console.log(m);
