let   - block scope
const - block scope 
var  - function scope 

{
   ---> let and const 
}

function (){

---------------> var 

}
//var is attached to window object 
//any variable will have access to outer scope 
//outer scope variable will not have access to inner scope.
==============================================
what is scope chain
//the limitation of variable withing the code.
three types of scope:
1.global scope - outside of all the function - let and const
2.function scope - inside the function 
3.block scope  - inside the curly braces
let and const - block scope 
var - function scope and attached to window object
=================================================
Hoisting:
    display();
    function display(){
        console.log("welcome to hoisting concept");
    }
1.Javascript run time engine
2.we have call stack
3.call stack execution context will be created for each function and one global execution context will be created 
4.each execution will have details about variable environment,functions,arguments,scope chain and this keyword.
5.Inside the global execution context all the varibale and function is stored thats way I can able to call function before declaration.
6.Inside the call stack first thing that is going to run is global execution context.
