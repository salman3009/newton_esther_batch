============================================================
Javascript you can write in two ways:
1.internal --->Inside the html file itself 
//you can use multiple script tag inside the html file. 
//Anywhere inside the html tag we can write either in head tag or body tag.
<script>
</script>
2.external ---> We are going to create separate .js file 
//in html we need to import their file location 
//It is more preferred way because html and css are in separate file 
//It will make code maintainability.
//Anywhere inside the html tag we can write either in head tag or body tag.
