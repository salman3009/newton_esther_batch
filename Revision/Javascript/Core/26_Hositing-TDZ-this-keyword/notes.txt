======================
What is hoisting?
//calling function before declaration
//this concept is called hoisting
//call stack
//each function execution context
//global execution context - first call stack
//global exectuion context all function and variable is defined here.
=========================================
tdz means =calling variable before its initialisation.

hoisting is possible with var and normal function declaration 

hoisting is not possible with let/const and arrow function and function expression even though it is store in var also.

function expression means storing the function inside the variable.
============================================
this - this will refer to current object.
arrow function we don't this keyword
arrow function will borrow nearby this keyword from scoping chain (outermost)
=============================================
vanilla javascript - pure javascript 
=========================================
Abstraction - hiding the content from actual implemention ( data hiding)
encapsulation - hiding the data from outside world or outside the class. (javascript we don't access modifier so encapsulation is not possible only wrapper get and set).
inheritance - reusing the parent class method and properties.
polymorphism - a child child will overwrite the method define in the parent class(once you have same name).
=====================================
