Sort():

1.if you have only number and you need in ascending order:
input.sort(function(a,b){
   return a-b;
})

2.if you have only number and you need in descending order:
input.sort(function(a,b){
return b-a;
})

3.if you have alphabets in lower case and you need in ascending order 
input.sort();

4.if you have alphabets in lower case and you need in descending order 
input.sort().reverse();
=================================================
indexOf - O(N)
if you have the value it will return that particular index.
if no match found it will return -1 
=============================================
includes - 
if you have value it will return true 
if you don't have the value it will return false.
================================================
Array.isArray(input) 
it is going to return true if array is found otherwise it will return false.
===============================================
for and while both will work in same way but syntax is different.
Both while and do-while main difference is do-while will run for one time in negative condition as well.
===========================================
break statement:
1.inside the switch statement 
2.inside the loop 
continue statement:
1.inside the loop.
============================================
break and return 
//return we can use only within the  function 
//inside the loop we can use return but that loop should be inside the function.
============================================
Loops:
1.for 
2.while 
3.dowhile 
4.for of 
5. forEach
===========================================
