All browser as compiler present in it 
If you want to run javascript outside the browser you need to have .nodejs
=======================================
Javascript you can write in two ways:
1.internal --->Inside the html file itself 
//you can use multiple script tag inside the html file. 
<script>
</script>
2.external ---> We are going to create separate .js file 
//in html we need to import their file location 
//It is more preferred way because html and css are in separate file 
//It will make code maintainability.
