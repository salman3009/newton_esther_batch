Function Declaration:
A function declaration also known as a function statement declares a function with a function keyword. The function declaration must have a function name.
Function declaration does not require a variable assignment as they are standalone constructs and they cannot be nested inside a functional block.
These are executed before any other code.
The function in function declaration can be accessed before and after the function definition.
Syntax:
<script>
function geeksforGeeks(paramA, paramB) {
    // Set of statements
}
</script>

A function Expression is similar to a function declaration without the function name.
Function expressions can be stored in a variable assignment.
Function expressions load and execute only when the program interpreter reaches the line of code.
The function in function expression can be accessed only after the function definition.
Syntax:

<script>
var geeksforGeeks= function(paramA, paramB) {
    // Set of statements
}
</script>
