        In its most general sense, the term "world" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to
        everything that is.[1] The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some
        conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a "plurality of worlds". Some treat the world as one
        simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. In scientific cosmology the
        world or universe is commonly defined as "[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will
        be". Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things
        could have been. Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every
        experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the "horizon of all horizons". In philosophy of mind,
        the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind. Theology conceptualizes
        the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being
        interdependent. In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a
        spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. A comprehensive representation of the world and our
        place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview. Cosmogony is the field that studies the
        origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the
        end of the world.
