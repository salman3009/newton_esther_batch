CSS - cascading stylesheet 
//It is use for presentation purpose.
//without css also we can able to develop website but presentation will not be good.
//Inside any browser three languages are supported by default 
     1.html 
     2.css 
     3.javascript 
//you can able to run css separately inside the browser.
//always we need to create html page before css.  

css properties:
color:red 
//if you have more then one property semi-colon in between is mandatory for inline style.
color:red;text-align:center;


Writing the css we have three approach:
   1.inline  - within the tag itself you are going to write the style.
   example:
   style="color:red"
   style -> attribute 
   color --> property of css or key of css 
   : --> colon operator
   red --> value of css 
   entire property enclosed with double quotes or single quotes
   2.internal 
      //internal style can be written anywhere inside the html page.
      //mostly it is written in the head tag and sometimes in body tag.
      example:
        <style>
          h2{
            color:red;
            text-align: center;
          } 
          p{
            color:blue;
            text-align: center;
          }      
       </style>
   3.external 
   // we are going to write html and css separately in two files:
   //external.html 
    <head>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="./external.css">
         //rel - relationship
    </head>
   //external.css
h1{
    color:green;
    text-align: center;
}
Element selector:
/.to select html tags to apply css.
head tag:
//title 
//meta tag 
//link tag
==========================
comparison:
1.inline
2.internal
3.external 
first priority:
1.inline -  always priority to inline style
Depends upon the browser last load will be given priority for internal and external
2.internal 
3.external
attribute: !important 
//it will give utmost priority for that style.
//please dont use this propery unnecessary. if something is breaking then only we have to use 
this property.
====================================
color property we can use hexa decimal color that is best approach:
#79216cbf
