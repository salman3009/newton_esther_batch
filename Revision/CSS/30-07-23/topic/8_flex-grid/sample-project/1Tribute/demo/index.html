        <div class="child2">
            Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He is the
            co-founder and CTO of Inrupt.com, a tech start-up which uses, promotes
            and helps develop the open source Solid platform. Solid aims to give
            people control and agency over their data, questioning many assumptions
            about how the web has to work. Sir Tim created his hypertext program while he was at the particle physics
            institute, Cern, in Geneva.The code he crafted made it far easier for scientists to share their research and
            information across a fledgling computer network.His hypertext program created a system to organise, link and
            browse net pages.
            The scientist did not wish to make money from his invention and so did not go on to privatise the program.
            Instead, he wanted it to be used to expand the potential of the web as a channel for free expression and
            collaboration. </div>
